# Custom Voting 

This project is call CustomVoting( or Polling ), employing javaFX, will allow user to create a custom Voting Pool for event or vote in class 

### Prerequisites

To modify my code, you only need basic knowledge of Java (Lists, Insertion Sorting, and I/O) and JavaFX ( in this code, the graphics were made mainly from JavaFX Dialog)

### Installing

To start the program, there is 3 ways:
1. simply open cmd and type java -jar link-to-jar\CustomVoting.jar
2. Run the CustomVote.exe
3. download the class CustomVoting and Candidate (remember to modify the package) and run it in a new project in IDE.

You should see a new window pops up
